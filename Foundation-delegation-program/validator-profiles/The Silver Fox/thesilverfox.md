     - Providing a Testnet node
    Category 2: Software engineering
     - As I am going through my journey of learning Javascript, GO and RUST are on my list to learn.  I've already provided some code contributions to other chains but they are very small.
	 - Help support node runners
    Category 3: Community growth
     - I am still working on an extensive Documentation site.
	 - I retweet/quote tweet most announcements.
    Category 4: Business development
     - Being avaliable for Aura when needs arise
	 - I still have every intention of writing the math paper on the DEX formula
